# Spam Detection using Naive Bayes

This is the sample of Spam Detection using Naive Bayes implemented in Python3.

# System Requirement

* Python3 version >= 3.6.x

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

# How to run

* You have to create a classifier file using training data-set
```
Run the `spam.py` file
```

__Note__: there will be a file named `spam_detection.classifier` is created.

* Running detection

```
Run the `detector.py` file
Find a collection of text that you want to test
Convert text into a single line
Paste it in the command-line input of the program `detector.py`
Exit the detection by type `exit`
```

# Future Improvement

* There should have an interface for testing the program
